# Creating a PGS for GDP using Arabidopsis data
This is an absurdist exercise to create a Polygenic score 
for Gross Domestic Product. Basically what I lay out here
is a GWAS using publicly available Arabdiopsis thaliana
genome data and country-of-origin GDP as my phenotype

## Install
If you want to run this on your own machine, I'd recommend 
setting up a new environment in using `conda` and then 
using the provided requirements. 

The simplest way you could do this if you already have 
`conda` installed would be

```
conda create --name gdp --file requirements/conda.txt
```
that should set up the `conda` environment for you to run
the notebook I've provided. 

## Acknowledgements
The idea for GWAS on GDP came from my troll-like muse, Matt Hahn
